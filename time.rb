puts "You can create a new instance of Time with ::new. This will use the current system time. ::now is an alias for this. You can also pass parts of the time to ::new such as year, month, minute, etc. When you want to construct a time this way you must pass at least a year. If you pass the year with nothing else time will default to January 1 of that year at 00:00:00 with the current system timezone."
